#Personality Prediction Project
<br>This project predicts an individual's personality based on responses to a set of questions aligned with the OCEAN (Big Five) personality traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. By analyzing your answers, the model provides insights into your personality profile.
